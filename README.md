Solutions for the Advent of Code 2019

## Spoiler alert!
This repository contains solutions for (hopefully at the end) all puzzles of the Advent of Code. Please
don't have a look deeper into the packages if you want to solve the puzzles by yourself first.

## Contributions welcome!
Contributions in any language are welcome. In case it needs some specific preconditions it would be
great to have a small `README.md` besides your example.

## Package structure
Each day is a own root directory. The layer below signals the language of the solution and after that comes a directory with your github handle. Please have a look on `$PROJECT_ROOT/day00` in case something is not clear.
